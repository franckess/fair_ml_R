# Creating fair machine learning models with Generative Adversarial Networks
We explore the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for fighting hidden bias in data in order to train a classifier that is both optimal and fair.

### Usage
We have used RStudio's Notebook: One can open the R Markdown file in RStudio.
